# Rubik Cube demo
Built as a MVC application to show both colour and real time feedback when pressing the controls, uses HTMX to interact with the server and gather the updated HTML to render. 

## Setup
- minimum version of dotnet 8 -> [dotnet 8.0.100](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/thank-you/sdk-8.0.100-windows-x64-installer)

## To run

- clone the repo
- `cd` into `RubikCube` `cd ./RubikCube`
- run `dotnet run` and go to `localhost:5095` on your browser

The browser will show the rubik cube in the folded view, and controls that are in the same order as the one in the online rubik cube solver
